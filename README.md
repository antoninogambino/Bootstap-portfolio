**My personal portfolio with Bootstrap challenge week 3**

This is the challenge of week 3 of the BootCamp from University of Birmingham

**User Story**

In this challenge I had to develop a portfolio through the use of Bootstrap. I had to include personal information and details of the projects I have currently on my GitHub and the ones I will make in the future which will be a great opportunity to showcase to potential employers. also showcase the skills that I will learn througout the bootcamp and a little bio about myself and how to contact me.

**Technology**

This project was developed using only HTML and CSS files - with the addition of the README file. Also, Bootstrap and FontAwesome.

**Acceptance Criteria**

This challenge was an opportunity to put in action what we have been discussed in the past 3 weeks. Moreover, this challenge helped me understand how to apply bootstrap and how it works. I still need to empower the concept but I am happy with the result. I followed the requirements which was requesting the following element within the porfolio:

- Navbar
- Hero section
- Work section
- Skills section
- Contact section
- Bio section 
- Footer section

I have worked with a basic white background with black elements, adding a nav bar with my name on the left side and some buttons which are linked to the various sections of the page.

For the hero section I used one my picture and rounded it up, with a short paragraph about what the webpage is about. Then you can find the work section where I showcase the projects I have worked/working/will work on while I am enrolled in the bootcamp. Moroever, for this section I have used the bootstrap cards, this helped me to structure the work - used canva to create cool images with the same size so it was simmetrical and then hyperlinked each card to the deployed repositories.

The skills section is a list of the skills which I will learn throughout the bootcamp. To develop this section I used bootstrap which made it very straighforward to list the topics covered during the course.

At the end there is row of contact details like LinkedIn, GitHub, Email and phone number. To make it more appealing I explored the FontAwesome tool which allowed me to insert the icons. Then included buttons with a hover effect how it was requested. Followed by a short biography about myself and the footer.
